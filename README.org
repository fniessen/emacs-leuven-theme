Note that, to get the whole heading lines fontified, you need to add the
following line into your =.emacs= file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; fontify the whole line for headings (with a background color)
(setq org-fontify-whole-heading-line t)
#+end_src

*** Agenda

Agenda with task list:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 640

** Install it

Though Leuven-theme has been added *in 24.4*, you can get a fresh version of it,
at any time, from [[http://melpa.milkbox.net/][MELPA]] or from [[https://github.com/fniessen/emacs-leuven-theme/][GitHub]].

*** Install the ELPA package

In Emacs 24.x, ~M-x list-packages~ is the /recommended way/ to list and install
packages.

MELPA keeps stable releases of Leuven theme.

See http://melpa.milkbox.net/#installing for more information on how to install
~leuven-theme~:

1. Just add MELPA to ~package-archives~,

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   ;; archives from which to fetch
   (setq package-archives
         (append '(("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/"))
                 package-archives))
   #+end_src

2. Call ~list-packages~,

3. Search for ~leuven-theme~,

4. Mark it for installation with ~i~, and

5. Execute the install action with ~x~.

*** Install the Git version

Get the full Git repository at https://github.com/fniessen/emacs-leuven-theme
using the following command:

#+begin_src sh
git clone git://github.com/fniessen/emacs-leuven-theme.git
#+end_src

Add the following in your =.emacs= file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "/path/to/emacs-leuven-theme")
(load-theme 'leuven t)                  ;; for Emacs 24+
#+end_src

Restart Emacs.

** Customize it

You don't like my large Org level-1 headings (though I made them larger on
purpose!)?

You should be able to get my theme and a smaller face by using something such
as:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(set-face-attribute 'org-level-1 nil :height 90) ; 9 pt font
#+end_src

That should change the font size without changing the colors.
