* Quotations

"Your Org-enhancing color-theme "leuven" ROCKS! ... and not just for Org." \\
-- /Johan S./

"Amazing theme. I've been switching themes like socks the past 3 years and
finally found a theme that fits me exactly." \\
-- /zeltak/

"The Leuven theme has quickly become my favorite -- the colors are great and the
visual details for Org mode are just wonderful." \\
-- /Steve B./

"I'm using leuven theme, which is a great theme for Org-mode. [...]  I cannot
use another emacs-theme." \\
-- /Joseph Vidal-Rosset/

"Leuven theme is awesome!" \\
-- /Joost Diepenmaat/

"I still am really enjoying using the theme -- wish I'd had it years back..." \\
-- /V./

"I've been using leuven-theme, which is a fantastic theme for Org-mode files." \\
-- /thnetos/

"I love leuven for it's magit faces. E.g. the different sections of the magit
status screen stand out much better with leuven than with any other theme I've
tried.  It's a good looking theme but what makes it stand out is the attention
the author has put into all of the different faces you find everywhere." \\

* Screenshots

** Org buffer (with code)

Fontified source code blocks:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 640
[[./images/fontified-src-code-blocks.png]]

Note that, to get the whole heading lines fontified, you need to add the
following line into your =.emacs= file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Fontify the whole line for headings (with a background color).
(setq org-fontify-whole-heading-line t)
#+end_src

** Agenda

Agenda with task list:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 640
[[./images/agenda-and-task-list.png]]

** NEW!  Dark version

There is now a dark version of Leuven-theme, automagically built by Thibault
Polge.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 640
[[./images/leuven-theme-dark.png]]

It surely will be improved over time, but this is a major first step into the
right direction.  A big thanks to him!

* Install it

Though Leuven-theme has been added in *Emacs 24.4* (October 2014), you can get
a fresh version of it, at any time, from [[http://melpa.milkbox.net/][MELPA]] or from [[https://github.com/fniessen/emacs-leuven-theme/][GitHub]].

** Install the ELPA package

In Emacs 24+, ~M-x list-packages~ is the /recommended way/ to list and install
packages.

MELPA keeps stable releases of Leuven theme.

See http://melpa.milkbox.net/#installing for more information on how to install
~leuven-theme~:

1. Just add MELPA to ~package-archives~,

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   ;; Archives from which to fetch.
   (setq package-archives
         (append '(("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/"))
                 package-archives))
   #+end_src

2. Call ~list-packages~,

3. Search for ~leuven-theme~,

4. Mark it for installation with ~i~, and

5. Execute the install action with ~x~.

** Install the Git version

Get the full Git repository at https://github.com/fniessen/emacs-leuven-theme
using the following command:

#+begin_src shell
git clone git://github.com/fniessen/emacs-leuven-theme.git
#+end_src

Add the following in your =.emacs= file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "/path/to/emacs-leuven-theme")
(load-theme 'leuven t)                  ; For Emacs 24+.
#+end_src

Restart Emacs.

** Customize it

You don't like my large Org level-1 headings or my large Org agenda-date heading
(though I made them larger on purpose!)?

Then, set the variable ~leuven-scale-outline-headlines~ to nil before the theme is
loaded.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq leuven-scale-outline-headlines nil)
(setq leuven-scale-org-agenda-structure nil)
#+end_src

The value can be:
- ~nil~ for unscaled,
- ~t~ for using the theme default, or
- a scaling number (that you choose to your liking!).

One way to do that is to it through ~M-x customize-variable~ and then restart
Emacs.
